## Background
A bullion store  provides a secure and reliable platform for individuals and investors to buy and sell precious metals, such as gold, silver and platinum. Serving as a trusted marketplace, a bullion store facilitates the acquisition of physical bullion products, including bars and coins, allowing customers to diversify their investment portfolios, hedge against economic uncertainties, and preserve wealth through tangible assets. The store typically offers a transparent and efficient transaction process, ensuring that customers can confidently engage in precious metal transactions while receiving quality products and accurate market information.

## Usability Testing

Prior to initiating usability testing, establishing clear test objectives, defining the test subjects, outlining the methodology, specifying tasks, and formulating rubrics for result evaluation are crucial steps. Consequently, I crafted a comprehensive usability testing plan to articulate the testing goals, the rationale behind the evaluation, and to adequately prepare for the upcoming test.

I proceeded to perform usability testing with a sample of 3 participants.. Detailed test cases were generated for each participant, documenting their interactions with the prototype. These test cases capture instances of mistakes, slips, and expressed confusions, providing valuable raw data for summarizing and analyzing patterns in user interaction with the prototype.



### Branding

Before diving into style design, I created a mood board on Pinterest to gather multiple inspirations around the specific attributes extracted from the project brief:

Project Objectives:

Brand Representation:
Reflect the client's brand identity through the store's design, incorporating colors, logos, and overall aesthetics that align with the company's image.

Customer Experience:
Prioritize a welcoming and secure environment for customers.
Design an intuitive layout that facilitates easy navigation and product discovery.
Consider the creation of interactive displays or information kiosks to educate customers on precious metals.

Security Measures:
Implement robust security measures to ensure the safety of valuable inventory.
Integrate advanced surveillance systems, alarm systems, and secure storage solutions.

Transaction Areas:
Design dedicated spaces for transactions, consultations, and customer interactions.
Ensure privacy for high-value transactions, while maintaining transparency in the buying and selling process.

Product Display:
Develop creative and visually appealing display solutions for showcasing various precious metals.
Consider lighting and materials that enhance the attractiveness of products without compromising security.

Based on this I created a branding guide with main colours being yellow and black which visually represents the project brief 
The combination of black and yellow in the bullion store theme suggests a harmonious blend of richness, elegance, and positivity. It creates a visually appealing environment that communicates the store's focus on valuable commodities while maintaining an optimistic and secure atmosphere for customers engaging in precious metal transactions.
