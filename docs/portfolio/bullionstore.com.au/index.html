          <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>A bullion store  provides a secure and reliable platform for individuals and investors to buy and sell precious metals, such as gold, silver and platinum. Serving as a trusted marketplace, a bullion store facilitates the acquisition of physical bullion products, including bars and coins, allowing customers to diversify their investment portfolios, hedge against economic uncertainties, and preserve wealth through tangible assets.

Notably, I placed special emphasis on optimizing the user experience for the event signup process, recognizing its significance as a crucial touchpoint. This particular focus aimed to ensure a smooth and enticing process for potential customers, acknowledging the potential impact on attracting new users and generating revenue for the bullion store.</p>
<h3 id="research-goals">Research Goals</h3>
<p>Market Analysis: Understand the landscape of bullion platforms to identify market trends, potential opportunities, and areas for differentiation.</p>
<p>Target Audience Profiling: Define and comprehend the demographics, preferences, and investment goals of the target audience for the bullion store.</p>
<p>Competitor Assessment: Analyze the main competitors in the bullion market, examining how they cater to customer needs and identifying their strengths and weaknesses to inform strategic positioning.</p>
<p>Transaction Process Evaluation: Investigate user experiences during the transaction process on bullion platforms, aiming to streamline and enhance the overall buying and selling experience.</p>
<h2 id="primary-research">Primary Research</h2>
<p>Research is my compass, delving into users&rsquo; frustrations and aspirations, shaping a design process rooted in their authentic needs for impactful solutions. It&rsquo;s the cornerstone that transforms nuanced understanding into user-centered design excellence.</p>
<p>Crafting a meticulous research plan is essential; it serves as a roadmap for the responsive website design journey.

This thoughtful planning lays the foundation for a robust research phase and facilitates the seamless integration of findings into the subsequent design process.</p>
<h2 id="secondary-research">Secondary Research</h2>
<p>the online bullion industry has been experiencing growth, driven by various factors such as economic uncertainties, investment diversification strategies, and technological advancements. Here are some key aspects and trends in the online bullion industry:</p>
<p>E-commerce Platforms: Many established bullion dealers and mints have expanded their presence online, offering customers the convenience of buying and selling precious metals from the comfort of their homes.
Marketplace Diversity: Online platforms provide a diverse range of precious metals, including gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, in various forms such as coins, bars, and rounds.
Educational Resources: To cater to both seasoned investors and newcomers, online bullion dealers often provide educational resources. These resources may include market insights, investment guides, and information about different precious metals.
Secure Transactions: Security is a paramount concern in the bullion industry. Online platforms use secure payment gateways and encryption to ensure the safety of financial transactions and personal information.
Real-Time Pricing: Many online bullion dealers offer real-time pricing information, allowing users to stay updated on market fluctuations and make informed investment decisions.
Storage Solutions: Some online bullion dealers offer storage solutions, allowing customers to purchase precious metals and have them stored in secure vaults. This is particularly attractive to investors who prefer not to physically store their metals.
Blockchain and Digitization: The integration of blockchain technology is emerging as a trend, providing transparency and traceability for precious metal transactions. Some platforms are exploring digitized representations of physical bullion assets.
Customer Reviews and Ratings: Online reviews and ratings play a significant role in the reputation of bullion dealers. Customers often share their experiences, influencing others&rsquo; decisions when choosing a platform.
Responsive Design: Given the increasing use of mobile devices, responsive website design is crucial for providing a seamless user experience across various screen sizes.
Regulatory Compliance: Compliance with financial regulations and industry standards is imperative in the online bullion industry. Reputable platforms adhere to these standards to build trust with customers.</p>
<h3 id="competative-analysis">Competative analysis</h3>
<p>To enhance the bullion store&rsquo;s user experience, I conducted a thorough exploration of functionalities and benefits offered by comparable platforms in the precious metals industry. My analysis focused on key components of UI and overall product functionality, pinpointing areas for improvement. This included evaluating the efficiency of the user onboarding process, ensuring seamless content accessibility, and exploring interactive features that engage users in the buying and selling processes.</p>
<h3 id="personas">Personas</h3>
<p>Based on research findings, I created a persona who repersents the target user of the Society and their needs and habits. This helped me to empathize with the end user on the remaining steps of the design process.</p>
<p>Creating user personas for a bullion store involves understanding the diverse needs and characteristics of potential users. Here are two sample user personas:</p>
<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/bullion-store/user-personas.png">
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<h3 id="task-flow">Task Flow</h3>
<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/bullion-store/taskflow.png">
<h3 id="user-flow">User Flow</h3>
<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/bullion-store/userflow.png">
<h2 id="wireframe">Wireframe</h2>
<h3 id="sketches">sketches</h3>
<p>After creating  a to-do list for designing the key screens identified in the task flow and user flow, I started sketching low-fidelity screens.
I can capture my ideas by pen and paper quickly by sketching.
It also enables me to examine my ideas before putting everything in the daunting process of digitizing.</p>
<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/bullion-store/low-fidelity1.png">
<h3 id="mid-fidelity-wireframes">Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
<p>Transitioning from initial sketches to mid-fidelity wireframes allowed me to refine the user interface, emphasizing visual consistency and hierarchy. Incorporating proven design patterns from competitors ensured alignment with industry standards, while integrating elements tailored to users&rsquo; goals and motivations. This stage facilitates collaborative feedback, ensuring a polished and user-centric design for the bullion store platform.
<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/bullion-store/mid-fidelity.png"></p>
<h2 id="usability-testing">Usability Testing</h2>
<p>Prior to initiating usability testing, establishing clear test objectives, defining the test subjects, outlining the methodology, specifying tasks, and formulating rubrics for result evaluation are crucial steps. Consequently, I crafted a comprehensive usability testing plan to articulate the testing goals, the rationale behind the evaluation, and to adequately prepare for the upcoming test.</p>
<p>I proceeded to perform usability testing with a sample of 3 participants.. Detailed test cases were generated for each participant, documenting their interactions with the prototype. These test cases capture instances of mistakes, slips, and expressed confusions, providing valuable raw data for summarizing and analyzing patterns in user interaction with the prototype.</p>
<h3 id="branding">Branding</h3>
<p>Before diving into style design, I created a mood board on Pinterest to gather multiple inspirations around the specific attributes extracted from the project brief:</p>
<p>Project Objectives:</p>
<p>Brand Representation:
Reflect the client&rsquo;s brand identity through the store&rsquo;s design, incorporating colors, logos, and overall aesthetics that align with the company&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>Customer Experience:
Prioritize a welcoming and secure environment for customers.
Design an intuitive layout that facilitates easy navigation and product discovery.
Consider the creation of interactive displays or information kiosks to educate customers on precious metals.</p>
<p>Security Measures:
Implement robust security measures to ensure the safety of valuable inventory.
Integrate advanced surveillance systems, alarm systems, and secure storage solutions.</p>
<p>Transaction Areas:
Design dedicated spaces for transactions, consultations, and customer interactions.
Ensure privacy for high-value transactions, while maintaining transparency in the buying and selling process.</p>
<p>Product Display:
Develop creative and visually appealing display solutions for showcasing various precious metals.
Consider lighting and materials that enhance the attractiveness of products without compromising security.</p>
<p>Based on this I created a branding guide with main colours being yellow and black which visually represents the project brief
The combination of black and yellow in the bullion store theme suggests a harmonious blend of richness, elegance, and positivity. It creates a visually appealing environment that communicates the store&rsquo;s focus on valuable commodities while maintaining an optimistic and secure atmosphere for customers engaging in precious metal transactions.</p>
<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/bullion-store/style_guide.png">
<h2 id="high-fidelity-wireframes--prototype">High-Fidelity Wireframes &amp; Prototype</h2>
<p>By applying established styles, I crafted high-fidelity wireframes that enable a thorough examination of the application&rsquo;s overall aesthetic appeal and visual balance. This stage allows for a detailed assessment of the design&rsquo;s look and feel, ensuring a cohesive and visually pleasing user interface.</p>
<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/bullion-store/high-fidelity1.png">
<h3 id="final-thoughts--next-steps">Final Thoughts + Next Steps</h3>
<p>Having completed the final prototype, I&rsquo;m confident that the initial goals set at the beginning of the design process for the Bullion Store application have been achieved. The app encompasses a variety of features centered around the discovery and management of precious metals, complemented by branding materials that align with the service&rsquo;s values.</p>
<p>Given additional time, I would explore further enhancements, specifically delving into the development of desirable features. These additions could infuse additional characteristics into the business, enhancing its competitiveness within the market. The current prototype lays a solid foundation, and these potential refinements could contribute to the app&rsquo;s overall success and user satisfaction for the Bullion Store.</p>
